Hello. I made game in React, which is based on adding up numbers to reach 9. To win the game you must use all numbers from 1 to 9 and you have five opportunities. Every time number is random. After click on selected, you can confirm or change your decision by click. If the selected number agrees with the drawn one, the button will turn green. Otherwise, it will be red. If you win or lose the game, at the end there will be a button to try again :).
